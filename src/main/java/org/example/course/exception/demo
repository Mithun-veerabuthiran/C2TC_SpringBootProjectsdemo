Here’s a detailed explanation of the provided Java code:

```java
package com.tns.course.exception;

@SuppressWarnings("serial")
public class ServiceException extends RuntimeException {

    public ServiceException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }

    public ServiceException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}
```

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. Package Declaration

```java
package com.tns.course.exception;
```
- This line specifies that the class `ServiceException` is part of the `com.tns.course.exception` package. Packages are used to organize Java classes and avoid naming conflicts.

#### 2. SuppressWarnings Annotation

```java
@SuppressWarnings("serial")
```
- This annotation tells the Java compiler to ignore warnings related to serialization.
- Specifically, it suppresses warnings about the absence of a `serialVersionUID` field, which is generally recommended for classes that implement `Serializable`. However, since this is a custom runtime exception and typically not serialized, the warning can be safely ignored.

#### 3. Class Declaration

```java
public class ServiceException extends RuntimeException {
```
- This declares a new class called `ServiceException`.
- It extends `RuntimeException`, meaning it is an unchecked exception (does not need to be declared in a method’s `throws` clause).
- Custom exceptions like this are often used to represent specific error conditions in an application’s service layer.

#### 4. Constructors

```java
public ServiceException(String message) {
    super(message);
}
```
- This constructor accepts a `String message` parameter.
- It passes the message to the superclass (`RuntimeException`), which can later be retrieved using `getMessage()`.

```java
public ServiceException(String message, Throwable cause) {
    super(message, cause);
}
```
- This constructor accepts both a `String message` and a `Throwable cause`.
- It passes both to the superclass. This is useful if you want to wrap another exception (the cause) inside your custom exception, preserving the original stack trace and error information.

### Usage

- `ServiceException` can be thrown in your application’s service layer when a business error occurs that you want to handle separately from other exceptions.
- Example:
  ```java
  if (courseNotFound) {
      throw new ServiceException("Course not found with ID: " + id);
  }
  ```

### Summary

- **Purpose:** Custom unchecked exception for service layer errors.
- **Features:** Two constructors for flexibility (with just a message or with both message and cause).
- **Best Practice:** Helps in clean error handling and separation of concerns in layered applications.
